            <p>
                Fewer than 25% of children do the amount of exercise that is recommended to 
                develop good mental and physical health. Therefore, Chairo was designed to 
                motivate exercise among 7-10 year old children, setting a habit that will 
                improve their quality of life in the long-term.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chairo fits comfortably into a child’s palm, and has a customisable personality 
                based on popular game characters. The device is estimated to cost £30, and the 
                child is encouraged to jump, run and dance in a 2m² area, making it affordable 
                and suitable for unsupervised home use. 
                Optical heart rate monitors measure the child's physical effort and reward it with skill points and 
                higher levels, displayed on an inbuilt OLED screen: Chairo does not require any 
                additional devices or equipment to use.
